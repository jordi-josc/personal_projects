# Odoo Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, sharing my ability and knowledge with everyone who wants!

## About me
I am a developer currently working with **Odoo 19**, with experience in:
- Developing custom modules.
- Customizing views (QWeb, XML).
- Automating business processes.
- Environment setup and deployments.

## Included projects

### [Private Contacts Access](./own_contacts/)
A custom security feature that restricts access to contacts in Odoo.
It can be installed in both environments: SaaS and SH.

### [Customer Discount Limit](./customer_discount_limit/)
A lightweight module that enforces a **maximum discount limit per customer** on sales orders.
It extends the `res.partner` model and integrates a validation in `sale.order.line` to ensure discounts do not exceed the configured limit.

### [Odoo Scripts](./odoo_scripts/)
Collection of small, practical scripts for Odoo database and admin tasks.
Includes utilities and one-off SQL scripts (example: `adapt_currency_decimal`). Each script has its own README with usage, safety notes, and examples.
